# Disabled rules — false positives or overly strict for this codebase:
#   SC1091 — not following source: sourced files not on PATH at lint time
#   SC2034 — variable appears unused: false positive in sourced helper files
#   SC2312 — consider invoking command separately to avoid masking return value
#             (enable=all adds this; too noisy for existing scripts)
#   SC2250 — prefer "${var}" over "$var": cosmetic, not a bug
#   SC2248 — prefer double-quoting even simple variable expansions: cosmetic
