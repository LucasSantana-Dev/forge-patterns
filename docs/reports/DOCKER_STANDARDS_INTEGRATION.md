## 🏗️ **Core Standards Integrated**

### **Three-State Service Model**

- **Running**: Full operation, normal resource usage
- **Sleeping**: Suspended operation, minimal resource usage (Docker pause)
- **Stopped**: No operation, zero resource usage

### **Resource Efficiency Standards**

- **Memory Optimization**: 50-70% reduction in sleep state
- **CPU Optimization**: Near-zero CPU usage during sleep
- **Wake Performance**: ~100-200ms vs 2-5 second cold starts
- **Cost Reduction**: 50-70% lower infrastructure costs

### **Service Classification Framework**

- **High Priority**: Core services (never sleep)
- **Normal Priority**: On-demand services (5-minute idle timeout)
- **Low Priority**: Resource-intensive services (3-minute idle timeout)

## 📊 **Performance Benefits Documented**

### **Efficiency Metrics**

```
Memory Reduction:    50-80% for sleeping services
CPU Reduction:       80-95% for idle services
Wake Time:           < 200ms for 90% of services
Service Density:     3-4x more services per resource unit
Cost Savings:        50-70% infrastructure cost reduction
```

### **Availability Standards**

```
Running Services:    99.9% availability
Sleeping Services:   99.8% effective availability
State Transitions:   99.9% successful sleep/wake operations
Error Recovery:      Automatic retry with exponential backoff
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Requirements**

### **Mandatory Configuration**

```yaml
services:
  [service-name]:
    resources:
      memory: '[limit]M'
      cpu: '[limit]'
      memory_reservation: '[reservation]M'
      cpu_reservation: '[reservation]'
    sleep_policy:
      enabled: true
      idle_timeout: [seconds]
      min_sleep_time: [seconds]
      memory_reservation: '[sleep-memory]M'
      priority: '[high|normal|low]'
    auto_start: false
```

### **Service Manager Requirements**

- Docker-in-Docker capability for container lifecycle
- Sleep/Wake API endpoints for manual control
- Auto-sleep background task with configurable policies
- Resource monitoring and alerting
- Health checks for all service states
