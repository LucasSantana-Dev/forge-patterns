# Development Workflow Validation Report

## ✅ Issue Fixed Successfully

The executable permission issue for the validation script has been resolved:

### Problem

```bash
fish: Unknown command. './patterns/cost/scripts/validate-development-workflow.sh' exists but is not an executable file.
```

### Solution Applied

   `chmod +x ./patterns/cost/scripts/validate-development-workflow.sh`
2. **Fixed regex syntax error**: Replaced problematic bash regex with `grep -E`
3. **Fixed YAML validation**: Updated to use corrected configuration file
4. **Fixed branch validation logic**: Corrected conditional expressions
